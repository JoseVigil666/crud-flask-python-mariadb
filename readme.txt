This a Website builded using a new stack for web development: FLASK, PYTHON and MARIADB in Linux.

Review the next information for install and use flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/ 
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.

First Install Python3 and Flask in Linux.
run 
$ python3 mfox.py

in your browser
http://localhost:5000/

I am starting a new website using this technology.
In this example just to use:
Invetory/brands
Invetory/products
Point of sales/Customers


===============================
Learn and Use Flask with Python.
For example, here is a valid "Hello, world!" web application with Flask:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
